# Git (Script) Aliases That Could Be Helpful

<br/>

Usage of terminal is one of the best things a programmer does. It makes us feel like a little hacker playing around with his cozy tool.

We write little tools (when ever possible) to automate small tasks or cut the pain of typing a very long commands. `Git` has the awesome feature of writing your own aliases to commands. I like it a lot and written a set of aliases that I use everyday (I call them short-codes) and I wanted to share them hoping to-be useful to others.
And it starts here ..
These are the list of aliases that I use everyday.

If you feel they are helpful, you can create your own aliases with the above list or I have created a git repo with detailed instructions to install and use them.
Make sure to reopen your terminal to see the changes.


> Iâ€™d recommend beginners to learn and understand actual commands before using any tools/aliases for git.
